## Open Mind

> **This open-mind starter application that can be used on any project**
> **It uses [ml5 library](https://ml5js.org/) to handle its machine learning section**

**If you have any _question_, _issue_ or _bug report_, open up a new issue or pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/cluster-11/open-mind-vanilla-javascript)**
<br />

_Note, since this plain html file uses `CDN` to load the `ml5` library, it might take some time to initially load the library on the browser, if you're planning to use this on production level application, you should use the npm module_
